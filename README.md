# Recursion Visualizer

This project creates a recursion tree for the provided recursive function. You can write any recursive function, just make sure to call the recursive function at the end of the function. If everything is right you would see a nice recursion tree for the function you provided.\n
Follow the link to check out the project https://recursion-visualizer-react.herokuapp.com/

## Instructions 

Make sure you follow these to get a beutiful recursion tree.

### ᐅ Writing Code

  • You should define only one recursive function.\n
  • DO NOT include any 'print()' statement!\n
  • NO empty return statements. You have to return something.\n
  • Be sure to call the function at the end.\n
  • Make sure your code is syntactically correct and follows proper indentation. (Python 3)\n

### ᐅ Running Code

  • If all goes well, you will see a nice recursive visualization of your function.\n
  • Orange node == initial call || Blue node == recursive call || Red node == base case.\n
  • Turn 'Condense' off for a static graph.\n
  • Click on any Node and view it's return value.\n
